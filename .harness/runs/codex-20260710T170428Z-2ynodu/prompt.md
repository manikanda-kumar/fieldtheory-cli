# Harness Worker Packet

## Contract

You are an internal worker for the use-harness router.
Return a concise report to the router; do not address the end user directly.
Do not claim success unless validation evidence is included.

## Assignment

- Run ID: codex-20260710T170428Z-2ynodu
- Backend: codex
- Task type: implement
- Workspace: /Users/manik/Github/fieldtheory-cli
- Permission mode: write-enabled
- Model: gpt-5.6-terra

## Objective

Review finding (P2) on your change: src/daily/coverage.ts:63 X freshness uses lastIncrementalSyncAt ?? lastFullSyncAt — an older incremental timestamp hides a newer full sync. Fix: report the maximum parsed timestamp across both fields (reuse latestBookmarkSyncAt helper if it fits, else compare parsed epochs). Adjust/extend the test if it pinned the old behavior. Run node --import tsx --test tests/daily.test.ts && npm run build. Concise summary.

## Scope

Use the objective and named files as scope. Do not broaden unless required.

## Constraints

- Match existing repo patterns.
- Do not commit changes.
- If changing files, report exact files changed.
- If validation cannot run, say why.

## Expected deliverable

1. Summary
2. Evidence
3. Files changed
4. Commands run
5. Verification status
6. Blockers

## Result shape

summary: string
evidence: string[]
files_changed: string[]
commands_run: { command: string, exit_code: number | null, summary: string }[]
verification: { status: "passed" | "failed" | "not_run", details: string }
blockers: string[]
